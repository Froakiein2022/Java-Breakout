This Breakout game is created using Java Swing.

While working on this project, I gained a better understanding of how Java Swing works and how to create graphical applications using Java.

Instructions:
Use the arrow keys to move the paddle.
You must clear all bricks in the current round to move on to the next round.
The game is over if you clear all 5 rounds or you lose all of your lives.
